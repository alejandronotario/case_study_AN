## Overview

KNN model building to predict the frequency of claims a customerâ€™s going to make with the company.

__2 methods__

- Method 1: Selected customers: with one year period, so the prediction is the claims count for the first year of a customer, it makes more sense than the first method, it is "probability of number of claims for this customer whithin their first policy year.

- Method 2: Selected customers: The wohle dataset. It means that the predictions accuracy could be misleading because the model takes the tiem periods as a variable and in actually the prediction requieres exactly the same period to work right.


## Steps

__Data clean up__

- Exploring data
- Setting up the target
- Imputation
- Handling ouliers

__Feature engineering__

- Scaling 
- Encoding
- New variables

__Modeling__

- Selecting model
- Tunning hyperparameters
- Applying

__Evaluation__

- Comparing predictions vs actual values
- Getting score
- Simulating a prediction game

## Folders

- __code__: it contains:
	- scripts: model applications (on of each method explained) to run at command line with python "simulator.py". It contains data processing and training for different numbers of neighbors inputs
	with a simulator which asks for a policy id to predict the number of claims group in which it is
	- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that allows to run the code visualizing results step by step with markdown explanations
- __presentation__: case study presentation as Rpres. To see in your browser run case_study.html with double click from your cloned repository presentation folder once you have downloaded it.
